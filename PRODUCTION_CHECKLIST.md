## Deployment Steps

1. **Prepare Environment**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy Backend**
   - Upload server directory to hosting platform
   - Configure environment variables
   - Start server: `npm start`

3. **Deploy Frontend**
   - Upload `manish-steel-final/build` directory to hosting platform
   - Configure domain and SSL
   - Test all functionality

4. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - [ ] Website loads correctly
   - [ ] Admin login works
   - [ ] Product catalog displays
   - [ ] Image uploads work
   - [ ] Contact forms submit
   - [ ] Custom order form works
   - [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
   - [ ] Search functionality works
   - [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor server logs
