# API Connection Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The application was experiencing API connection failures in the following areas:

1. Malformed URLs with missing colon (`https//` instead of `https://`) causing `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors
2. Environment variable misconfigurations with `http://https://` prefixes
3. Inconsistent URL handling across different components
4. Top Products and Most Selling Products sections not loading due to connection issues

## Files Fixed

### Environment Files
- **`.env.development`**: Fixed malformed URL with double protocol (`http://https://`) 

### Core API Services
- **`apiUrlHelper.js`**: Enhanced to detect and fix common URL format errors including missing colons
- **`api.js`**: Updated to use the improved sanitizeApiUrl utility
- **`portDiscovery.js`**: Updated all API endpoint tests to use sanitizeApiUrl for consistent URL handling

### Components
- **`TopProductsSection.js`**: Simplified URL handling by using sanitizeApiUrl
- **`MostSellingProductsSection.js`**: Simplified URL handling by using sanitizeApiUrl
- **`ApiHealthCheck.js`**: Fixed URL validation to specifically check for proper protocols
- **`ApiDebugger.js`**: Added new component for comprehensive API connection debugging

## Key Improvements

1. **Centralized URL Handling**
   - All API URL construction now goes through the `sanitizeApiUrl` utility
   - Added detection for common URL format errors like `https/` and `http/`
   - Consistent error handling across all API connections

2. **Enhanced Error Detection**
   - Added comprehensive ApiDebugger component for testing all endpoint connections
   - Better logging for API connection failures
   - Testing of health, products, and featured products endpoints

3. **Environment Variable Safety**
   - Fixed invalid environment variables in .env.development
   - Added validation to prevent double protocol prefixes
   - Consistent URL format regardless of environment source

## Testing
The API connections have been tested with:
- Direct health endpoint checks
- Product endpoint checks
- Featured products endpoint checks

All endpoints are now accessible and returning the expected 200 status code.

## Future Prevention
1. The `apiUrlHelper.js` utility should be used for all API URL construction
2. URL validation should specifically check for complete protocol prefixes (`http://` and `https://`)
3. The API test script and ApiDebugger component can be used to verify API accessibility

## How to Use ApiDebugger

The ApiDebugger component has been temporarily added to the HomePage for development environments only.
This component:

1. Tests multiple URL configurations
2. Shows environment variables being used
3. Displays detailed success/failure results for each endpoint
4. Helps identify any remaining connection issues

To use it:
- Run the app in development mode
- Scroll to the bottom of the HomePage
- Review the API connection test results
- Remove the component from HomePage.js when issues are resolved
