# API URL Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The application was experiencing API connection failures due to malformed URLs. Specifically, URLs starting with `https//` (missing colon after "https") were being used, which caused the browser to throw `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors.

## Files Fixed
1. **ApiHealthCheck.js**: Updated URL validation to specifically check for `http://` and `https://` prefixes
2. **api.js**: Fixed the URL validation logic
3. **TopProductsSection.js**: Fixed URL validation in the product fetching logic
4. **MostSellingProductsSection.js**: Fixed URL validation in the product fetching logic
5. **apiUrlHelper.js**: Enhanced the URL sanitization to detect and fix common URL format issues including missing colons

## Changes Made
1. Changed all URL validation from:
   ```javascript
   if (!url.startsWith('http')) {
     url = 'https://' + url;
   }
   ```
   To:
   ```javascript
   if (!url.startsWith('http://') && !url.startsWith('https://')) {
     url = 'https://' + url;
   }
   ```

2. Added specific handling for malformed protocols in `apiUrlHelper.js`:
   ```javascript
   if (cleanUrl.startsWith('http/')) {
     cleanUrl = cleanUrl.replace('http/', 'http://');
   } else if (cleanUrl.startsWith('https/')) {
     cleanUrl = cleanUrl.replace('https/', 'https://');
   }
   ```

## Testing
A new script `test-api-connection.sh` was created to verify the API endpoints are correctly accessible. The script tests:
- Health endpoint: `https://manish-steel-api.onrender.com/health`
- Products endpoint: `https://manish-steel-api.onrender.com/api/products`
- Featured products endpoint: `https://manish-steel-api.onrender.com/api/products/featured`

All endpoints are now accessible and returning the expected 200 status code.

## Root Cause
The issue was likely caused by a typo during URL construction or environment variable setup. Instead of using `https://`, some parts of the code were using `https//` (missing the colon), which is not a valid URL protocol format.

## Future Prevention
1. We've updated the `apiUrlHelper.js` utility to be more robust at handling common URL format errors
2. All URL validations now specifically check for complete protocol prefixes (`http://` and `https://`)
3. The API test script can be used before deployments to verify API accessibility
